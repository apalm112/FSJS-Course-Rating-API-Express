# FSJS Project #11: Course-Rating-API-Express
A REST API using Express. The API will provide a way for users to review educational courses: users can see a list of courses in a database; add courses to the database; and add reviews for a specific course. This project uses REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, along with Mongoose and MongoDB for data modeling, validation, and persistence.
